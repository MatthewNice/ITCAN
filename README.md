# ITCAN
 Improved Tracking from Controller Area Network

This package is a collection of functions and classes to take CAN data of pre-processed but not well-tracked RADAR detections, and make them into well-organized trajectories. This repository also contains the functions to analyze the trajectories extracted from the CAN data.
